This working paper includes a brief theoretical legal study on market regulation. It translates economic theories of sectoral market regulation into established concepts of administrative law. The legal methods employed for sectoral regulation and the corresponding types of legal norms are analysed. This is followed by a discussion of the nature of statutory legislation and the distinctive discretionary administrative powers. Lastly, particular instruments of regulation distinguished in economics are situated within the framework of administrative law.
