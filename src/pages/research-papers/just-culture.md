This article is the second part of a series on air accident investigations. With reference to aircraft accident and incident investigations, and the use of results of such investigations, the article discusses the issue of the proper balance between ensuring aviation safety and executing responsibility. The possible conflicts between the realisation of both goals in the context of criminal, civil or administrative proceedings are explored. The article concentrates on just culture principles aimed at balancing safety and responsibility in aviation. This includes a discussion of EUROCONTROL heritage in this respect and of the implementation of these principles in Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention, Regulation 966/2010/EU and Polish aviation law. The analysis focuses on the precautionary goal of investigations, institutional independence and relations between safety investigations and other proceedings. It concludes with recommendations for the lawmaker.
