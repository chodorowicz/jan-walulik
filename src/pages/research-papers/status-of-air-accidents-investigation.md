This article is the third part of a series on air accident investigations. It develops on the legal status of findings of aircraft accident and incident investigations. The extent to which such findings may be binding in civil, criminal and administrative procedures is analysed. Emphasis is placed on the probative value of aircraft accident and incident investigation final reports. Further, the possible status of such reports as official documents and the consequences of such status for particular types of proceedings is discussed. Lastly, possible constraints to the use of reports which arise from general procedural rules as well as from specific provisions of air law are investigated.
