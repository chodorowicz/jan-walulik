The article starts with a discussion on the present state of international criminal air law (the Tokyo Convention 1963, the Hague Convention 1970, the Montreal Convention 1971 and the Montreal Protocol 1988), including general characteristics of this law, key provisions of international treaties and their implementation in the national regime. Some inadequacies of current regulations are revealed. The second part concentrates on changes brought about by the Beijing Convention and the Beijing Protocol of 2010 concerning the scope of criminalisation, applicable law, jurisdiction, information obligations, extradition, non-discrimination and fair trial. The concluding part presents general remarks concerning the implementation of the Convention and the Protocol in Poland.
